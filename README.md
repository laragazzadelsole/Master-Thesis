This thesis is driven by the urgency of addressing climate change and aspires to reconcile aviation's environmental impact with the growing demand for air travel. The study focuses on assessing how airline companies respond to changes in airport charges, specifically examining the causal impact of increased airport fees on flight frequencies and carbon emissions at the world's busiest airports. The feasibility of implementing an environmental charge is explored as an alternative to the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) launched by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), in combination with other measures to achieve the ambituous goals of Carbon Neutral Growth from 2020 (CNG2020) and net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. CORSIA serves as a global market-based mechanism to harmonize environmental policies in aviation. CORSIA aims to offset emissions that cannot be reduced through other means by allowing airlines to invest in carbon-offsetting projects. However, there is concern that CORSIA may not be stringent enough to reach its net-zero emissions target.
Unlike CORSIA, which compensates for emissions after they are released, an environmental charge directly reduces emissions at the source, preventing CO2 from entering the atmosphere.

The research uses a comprehensive dataset covering 87 major airports from 2017 to 2022, excluding 2020, resulting in 4,479 data points. Two Stage Least Square with Robust Linear Regression and an instrumental variable is used to estimate the impact that a raise in airport charges has on the number of departing seats and CO2 emissions in different scenarios, which depend on the geographical area of the departure airport and the length of the flight. 

The main finding of this study reveals that, for airline companies operating medium-haul flights departing from European countries, the United States, or Canada, a 1% increase in charges leads to a reduction of departing seats by -0.83%. Consequently, this translates to a direct reduction in emissions by -1.39%. 
However, in the other scenarios, the results lack statistical significance, possibly due to the substantial heterogeneity within the dataset. In fact, the second group of countries encompasses a wide range of geographical regions, including South America, the Middle East, and Asia, with very different charge ranges. Moreover, the varying flight durations for long-haul flights, spanning from 6 to 16 hours, give rise to markedly distinct emissions and charge structures.

In practical terms, the environmental charge would increase by 5.23 times the cost per passenger for medium-haul flights departing from a European Union country. For instance, to fly from Stockholm - Arlanda Airport to Lisbon Airport an airline company should face a cost increment from 7.89€ to 41.68€ per passenger.
